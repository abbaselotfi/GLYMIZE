# GLYMIZE Admin API

This Cloudflare Worker is the runtime and write authority for catalogue,
runtime-account, and patient/encounter operations described in the
[runtime-of-record ADR](../../docs/architecture/RUNTIME_OF_RECORD.md). Patient
access uses request-time D1 RBAC as documented in
[the patient-access RBAC note](../../docs/architecture/PATIENT_ACCESS_RBAC.md).

Catalogue publication is the explicit temporary exception: it authenticates
with GitHub OAuth, accepts only the configured GitHub login, validates the
catalogue payload, and updates only
`apps/web/public/data/admin-catalog.json`. That GitHub principal cannot be used
as a patient, portal-clinician, or encounter authorization role.

Required Worker secrets:

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SESSION_SECRET` (a long random value)

Deployment outline:

1. Create a GitHub OAuth App. Set its callback URL to
   `https://shiny-block-9d4a.abbaselotfi.workers.dev/auth/callback`.
2. Review the non-secret values in `wrangler.jsonc`.
3. Run `pnpm --filter @glymize/admin-worker exec wrangler login`.
4. Add each secret with
   `pnpm --filter @glymize/admin-worker exec wrangler secret put <NAME>`.
5. Deploy with `pnpm --filter @glymize/admin-worker deploy`.
6. Set the GitHub repository variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_URL` to the final
   Worker origin `https://shiny-block-9d4a.abbaselotfi.workers.dev` and re-run
   the Pages workflow.

`GITHUB_BRANCH` is intentionally fixed to `main`. Deploy the Worker only after
this feature branch has been reviewed and merged.
